# Progress Portfolio
## Deadline: December 8, 2021

For your comp progress report at the end of the Fall 2021 semester, you will be submitting a progress portfolio of your work. This portfolio will include the following components (comprised of a single PDF document in the order listed below):

1. A reflection;
2. Your progress document(s); and
3. A realistic timeline and to-do list for Spring 2022.

### The Reflection

Although your reflection will be the first document of this portfolio, it should be the last document you write. This reflection is your opportunity to tell your reader about your comping experience – both the good and bad; challenges and parts that have come together with ease; those things that have taken too much time and those that have fallen into place beautifully; the things you have enjoyed and the things you hate. This document should be written in the first person and addressed to your readers. Although this is your opportunity to name the hard parts of comping and things you have hated, the quality and professional tone of your cover letter cannot be compromised. Your readers will use this reflection to contextualize your progress and assess your ability to reflect and write in a professional manner. In addition to sharing your experiences and feelings you have experienced during the first semester, you are to describe what progress you have made, resources you need to be successful next semester, and what you have learned about yourself during the semester. 

### Progress Document(s)

Together with your first reader, you will determine what you will submit as evidence of your progress this semester. This evidence must come in the form of a written document, ideally a part of your final comp. It must include work that has been completed since your defense. We expect you to set a challenging and attainable goal for this progress document. The document you chose to write should illustrate the progress and high-level thinking you have done this semester. It should also be significant – in both length and depth of knowledge – to showcase that you are in fact completing 600-level course work. 

### Timeline

In your portfolio, you must also include a realistic timeline of your work, week-by-week, for Spring 2022. 

### Submission

Before you submit your progress portfolio please make sure all documents to be included in the portfolio are converted to a single PDF. Then, in the `progress_portfolio` repository on GitHub's website, navigate to `Add File`, select `Upload Files` option, drag your PDF into the appropriate section, and click on `Commit Changes`.
